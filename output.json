          "As we build programs, we design data structures and write code to manipulate those data structures. There are many ways to write programs and by now, you probably have written some programs that are \u201cnot so elegant\u201d and other programs that are \u201cmore elegant\u201d. Even though your programs may be small, you are starting to see how there is a bit of art and aesthetic to writing code.",

If you are working on a million-line program, you can never keep the entire program in your mind at the same time. We need ways to break large programs into multiple smaller pieces so that we have less to look at when solving a problem, fix a bug, or add a new feature.",

It is more complicated to write the code to use a database to store data than Python dictionaries or flat files so there is little reason to use a database unless your application truly needs the capabilities of a database. The situations where a database can be quite useful are: (1) when your application needs to make many small random updates within a large data set, (2) when your data is so large it cannot fit in a dictionary and you need to look up information repeatedly, or (3) when you have a long-running process that you want to be able to stop and restart and retain the data from one run to the next.",

When you start making links between tables, it is important to do some thoughtful design and follow the rules of database normalization to make the best use of the database\u2019s capabilities.

We also dump the JSON after parsing and \u201cpretty-print\u201d it with an indent of four characters to allow us to pore through the data when we want to extract more fields.",

There is a great deal more data available in the returned JSON. If you look in the output of the program, you can also see that the \u201cfind the friends\u201d of a particular account has a different rate limitation than the number of timeline queries we are allowed to run per time period.",

          "(Allen B. Downey)",
          "In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.",
          "One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.",
          "Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:",
          "Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.",
          "Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and define each term at first use.",

          "Jeff and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by Chris Meyers, and in 2001 we released How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python, also under the GNU Free Documentation License. As Green Tea Press, I published the book and started selling hard copies through Amazon.com and college book stores. Other books from Green Tea Press are available at greenteapress.com.",
          "In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.",
          "Over the last five years I have continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises. In 2008 I started work on a major revision\u2014at the same time, I was contacted by an editor at Cambridge University Press who was interested in publishing the next edition. Good timing!",
